## 📋 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Verify Database Features (1-2 hours)
1. Check `/db/views.sql` - ensure views are created
2. Check `/db/procedures.sql` - ensure ≥2 stored procedures exist
3. Check `/db/triggers.sql` - ensure ≥1 trigger exists
4. Run all SQL files to verify they work
5. Test database features

### Phase 2: Build Frontend (8-16 hours)
1. **Option A: React App** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   cd web
   npx create-react-app .
   # Build components for each feature
   ```

2. **Option B: Simple HTML/JS**
   - Create HTML pages
   - Use fetch API to call backend
   - Basic styling

3. **Key Pages Needed:**
   - Login/Register page
   - Dashboard (role-based)
   - Property/Listing management
   - Rental request flow
   - Contract signing
   - Issue reporting
   - Reviews

### Phase 3: Connect & Test (4-6 hours)
1. Connect frontend to API
2. Test all user flows
3. Fix bugs
4. Create test documentation

### Phase 4: Performance & Security (2-3 hours)
1. Run EXPLAIN on key queries
2. Document performance improvements
3. Verify security measures
4. Create performance report

### Phase 5: Final Documentation (2-3 hours)
1. Update README with setup instructions
2. Create demo video/screenshots
3. Finalize presentation slides
4. Complete project report
