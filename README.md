# Off-Campus Housing Management System (Verified Housing for Students & Workers)
- Nguyen Van Duy Anh

## 1) Brief Description (Problem + Solution)
**Problem:** Students and workers near universities/industrial zones often find housing through Facebook/Zalo groups. This leads to unverified listings, inconsistent information, no contract standardization, and difficult handling of disputes/safety/maintenance issues.

**Solution:** This project builds an **Off-Campus Housing Management System** that connects:
- **Landlords** (create/manage listings, handle contracts, respond to issues)
- **Students/Workers** (search verified listings, submit rental requests, sign contracts, report issues)
- **University Admin / Industrial Park Management** (verify landlords/properties, manage incidents and trust)

Key focus: **verified listings, structured contracts, and issue/incident workflows**.

---

## 2) Functional Requirements
### 2.1 User & Access
- User registration/login (Landlord / Tenant / Admin roles)
- Profile management (contact info, affiliation if applicable)
- Role-based dashboards and permissions

### 2.2 Listings & Search
- Landlord can create/update/delete listings (property/room, price, deposit, availability, amenities)
- Tenant can browse/search/filter listings (price, distance, type, availability, amenities)
- Listing verification badge (Verified / Pending / Rejected)

### 2.3 Rental Requests & Contracting
- Tenant submits rental requests to a listing
- Landlord can accept/reject requests
- Generate a contract from an accepted request
- Contract lifecycle: `DRAFT -> SENT -> SIGNED -> ACTIVE -> TERMINATED`
- Support shared housing: multiple tenants in one contract (contract-tenants)

### 2.4 Issue Reporting (Incidents / Maintenance / Disputes)
- Tenant or landlord can create issue reports linked to a contract
- Issue categorization (maintenance, safety, noise, scam, hygiene, dispute)
- Admin can triage/assign issues; track status + resolution time
- Evidence attachments (photos/documents) for issue reports (metadata + file links)

### 2.5 Reviews & Feedback (Verified Stays)
- Tenants can review listing/landlord **only after a valid contract**
- Ratings + comments, with “verified stay” derived from contract

### 2.6 Admin Verification & Governance
- Admin verifies landlords and/or properties (inspection/approval workflow)
- Admin analytics dashboard (verification stats, incident counts, response time)

---

## 3) Non-Functional Requirements
- **Data Integrity:** FK constraints, unique constraints, NOT NULL, controlled status enums
- **3NF Design:** minimize redundancy (use IDs instead of duplicated username/email in tables)
- **Security:** RBAC (roles/privileges), password hashing, least-privilege DB users
- **Reliability:** audit logs for critical actions (contract state changes, issue resolution)
- **Performance:** indexes on common filters and joins; evidence of query optimization
- **Scalability:** design supports multiple organizations (universities/industrial zones)
- **Maintainability:** clean schema naming conventions; predictable repository structure
- **Web Integration:** CRUD interface + API endpoints + validation to prevent SQL injection
- **Testing:** unit + integration tests; test dataset; reproducible scripts

---

## 4) Planned Core Entities (Brief Outline)
> Final ERD will include at least **4+ entities** (requirement), but our MVP includes more for realism.

### Core
- **users**: accounts, roles (landlord/tenant/admin), status
- **organizations**: university/industrial park/company (optional but recommended)
- **user_affiliations**: links users to organizations (verification context)
- **properties**: owned by landlord, address, zone/org association
- **rooms**: belongs to a property, capacity, base rent
- **listings**: references either a property or a room (exactly one), price/deposit/status
- **rental_requests**: tenant requests a listing; status tracking
- **contracts**: created from accepted request; rent/deposit/dates/status
- **contract_tenants**: many-to-many for shared contracts
- **issue_reports**: incidents linked to contract, status, severity, assignment
- **issue_attachments**: file metadata for issues (URL/path + uploader)
- **reviews**: contract-bound reviews; rating/comment; target type (listing/landlord)
- **verifications**: admin verification workflow for landlord/property/listing
- **audit_logs**: records important actions for accountability

---

## 5) Tech Stack
**Database:** MySQL 8
**Backend API:** Node.js + Express (or Flask)  
**Frontend:** React (or simple server-rendered pages if scope is tight)  
**Auth:** JWT/session + bcrypt password hashing  
**ORM (optional):** Prisma / Sequelize (or raw SQL with prepared statements)  
**DevOps:** Docker + docker-compose (recommended for reproducibility)  
**Testing:** Postman collection + backend unit tests (Jest/PyTest)

## 6) Team Members and Roles
- **Member 1 (Nguyen Van Duy Anh):** Project Manager + Requirements + Documentation, QA/Security (test plan, SQL injection prevention, RBAC)
- **Member 2 (Duong Hien Chi Kien):** Database Architect (ERD, normalization, DDL, views, indexes)
- **Member 3 (Tran Anh Chuong):** Backend Developer (API, procedures integration, auth), Frontend Developer (UI, CRUD flows, admin dashChuong

## 9) Repository Structure (Suggested)

## 10) How to Run (Example)
1. Create database and user (MySQL)
2. Run `/db/schema.sql`, then `/db/seed.sql`
3. Start backend (`/api`)
4. Start frontend (`/web`)
5. Open app in browser and test core flows

---

## 11) Core MVP Demo Flow (What we will show)
1) Admin verifies landlord/property → listing becomes “Verified”  
2) Tenant searches → submits rental request  
3) Landlord accepts → contract created → signatures recorded  
4) Tenant reports an issue → admin assigns → resolution tracked  
5) Tenant submits review (only after contract)
